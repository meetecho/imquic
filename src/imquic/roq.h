 * \brief  imquic RoQ public interface (headers)
 * \details Public interface to the RTP Over QUIC (RoQ) native support
 * in the imquic library. This is where public functions are callbacks to
 * interact with the RoQ features of the library are defined.
 *
 * \ingroup API RoQ Core
 *
 * \page roqapi Native support for RTP Over QUIC (RoQ)
 *
 * As explained in the \ref publicapi, \ref imquic_create_server and \ref imquic_create_client
 * are the methods you can use to create a new, generic, QUIC server or
 * client, with the related callbacks to be notified about what happens
 * on new or existing connections. That API assumes you'll be entirely
 * responsible of the application level protocol details, though.
 *
 * Out of the box, imquic provides native support for a few specific
 * protocols, meaning it can deal with the lower level details of the
 * application level protocol, while exposing a simpler and higher level
 * API to use the protocol features programmatically. RTP Over QUIC is
 * one of those protocols.
 *
 * When you want to use the native RoQ features of imquic, you must not
 * use the generic functions and callbacks, but will need to use the RoQ
 * variants defined in this page instead. Specifically, to create a RoQ
 * server you won't use \ref imquic_create_server, but will use \ref imquic_create_roq_server
 * instead; likewise, a \ref imquic_create_roq_client variant exists for creating
 * RoQ clients too.
 *
 * The same applies to callbacks for incoming events. Attempting to use
 * the generic callback setters on a RoQ endpoint will do nothing, and
 * show an error on the logs: you'll need to use the RoQ specific callbacks.
 * This means that to be notified about a new RoQ connection (whether
 * you're a client or a server), you'll use \ref imquic_set_new_roq_connection_cb,
 * while to be notified about connections being closed you'll need to
 * use \ref imquic_set_roq_connection_gone_cb instead. The same considerations
 * made on reference-counting connections in generic callbacks applies
 * here too, since the same structs are used for endpoints and connections:
 * it's just the internals that are different. Starting the endpoint after
 * configuring the callbacks, instead, works exactly the same way as in
 * the generic API, meaning you'll be able to use \ref imquic_start_endpoint.
 *
 * Being notified about incoming RTP packets is much easier as well, as
 * rather than having to worry about handling incoming \c STREAM or
 * \c DATAGRAM data, and potentially demultiplex/reconstruct RTP packets
 * across multiple \c STREAM chunks, using \ref imquic_set_rtp_incoming_cb
 * you can be notified about full RTP packets instead, independently of
 * how they were multiplexed by the sender. The callback will also notify
 * you about the flow ID associated with the packet, making it much easier
 * to just handle the application level specifics (e.g., mapping incoming
 * packets to a specific session).
 *
 * Sending RTP packets follows the same simplification, since all you need
 * to do is use \ref imquic_roq_send_rtp and specify which multiplexing mode
 * you want to use for encapsulating the RTP packet on top of QUIC. Depending
 * on whether \c DATAGRAM or \c STREAM are used, the RoQ stack will handle
 * that internally for you: when using \c STREAM , it's up to you to tell
 * the stack when to close the stream, thus allowing you to choose how
 * many packets to send over the same stream (e.g., all packets on the
 * same stream, one stream per packet, or anything in between).
